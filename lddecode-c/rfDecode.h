class RFDecode {
    /*The core RF decoding code.

    This decoder uses FFT overlap-save processing(1) to allow for parallel processing and combination of
    operations.

    Video filter signal path:
    - FFT/iFFT stage 1: RF BPF (i.e. 3.5-13.5mhz NTSC) * hilbert filter
    - phase unwrapping
    - FFT stage 2, which is processed into multiple final products:
      - Regular video output
      - 0.5mhz LPF (used for HSYNC)
      - For fine-tuning HSYNC: NTSC: 3.5x mhz filtered signal, PAL: 3.75mhz pilot signal

    Analogue audio filter signal path:

        The audio signal path is actually more complex in some ways, since it reduces a
        multi-msps signal down to <100khz.  A two stage processing system is used which
        reduces the frequency in each stage.

        Stage 1 performs the audio RF demodulation per block typically with 32x decimation,
        while stage 2 is run once the entire frame is demodulated and decimates by 4x.

    EFM filtering simply applies RF front end filters that massage the output so that ld-process-efm
    can do the actual work.
